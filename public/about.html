    <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Stefan Daniel Danca, i was born on 11 Januray 1989, in Bacau, Romania, 
  I leaved here till i was 14 years old and after I moved to Italy where I've studied 
  at high school and I lived there till my 30's.

</p>

<p>
  In 2019 I decided to return in Romania due to lack of work, 
  and since the same year I'm working on customer assistance.
</p>

<p>
  In 2022 I started to learn Java, but because of it's difficult and because of lack of time, after more than 2 years I made
  no progress, so in 2024 I decided to leave Java study and to try web development.
  Since 2024 I started to follow several courses about HTML and I started also to learn MySQL and JS.
  In this moment, before I start the Angela's course, I made a HTML page only (with no JS backend) made entirely in romanian language.
  My goal is to learn JS and MySQL till 2026.
